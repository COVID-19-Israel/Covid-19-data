 * Figures may change based on findings from ongoing local epidemiological investigation efforts.
 
○ KCDC decided to strengthen the entry procedure for incoming travellers(Korean national and foreigners for long-term stay) from the US, taking into account that the number of imported cases from the US has increased. As a result, as of 13 April, the incoming travellers from the US must get tested within three days of self-quarantine upon arrival. KCDC also asked the people in self-quarantine for strict adherence to the quarantine guideline.
 
○ Although the number of newly confirmed cases has decreased, a risk of large outbreak still remains if social distancing is loosened. If large outbreak occurs, health system could be destructed and fatal cases could soared from high-risk group. Since COVID-19 often causes very light symptoms or no symptoms at all, individuals may not be able to know that they are infected. Furthermore, the transmissibility of COVID-19 is very high even from the early stage of infection. Therefore, it is critical for the public to comply with the guidelines for infection prevention and control. 
 




 
Call to actions for all citizens
 
 
 ① Cancel or postpone all non-essential gatherings, dining out, social events, and travel plans.
 * There have been numerous reports overseas of transmission by eating together. All meetings and events involving sharing a meal should especially be postponed or canceled.
 
 ② If you have fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, or other respiratory symptoms, do not go to work. Stay home and get sufficient rest.
 
 ③ Avoid leaving home except to purchase necessities, to get medical care, or to go to work.
 
 ④ Avoid handshakes and other forms of physical contact. Keep a 2-meter distance from each other.
 
 ⑤ Wash your hands, cover up your sneezes/coughs, and generally maintain strict personal hygiene.
 
 ⑥ Disinfect and ventilate your space every day.
