 * Figures may change based on findings from ongoing local epidemiological investigation efforts.
 
○ Epidemiological links have been found for 82.0% of the total cases; 9.9% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 2.
 
○ From a nightlife entertainment venue in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, 2 cases have been confirmed. Contact tracing and epidemiological investigation are underway.
 
○ From Euijeongbu St. Mary’s Hospital in Gyeonggi Province, 4 additional cases were confirmed during self-quarantine. In total, 52 cases (patients = 18; staff/workers = 14; family/contacts = 20) have been confirmed since 29 March.

○ From Siji Geriatric Hospital in Daegu City, 5 additional cases were confirmed from testing of all 399 patients and staff under cohort isolation. In total, 14 cases (patients = 8; staff/workers = 6) have been confirmed since 5 March. (The figures on Table 2 are based on cases reported to KCDC before 0:00 of 8 April and may differ from above.)
 
○ Epidemiological investigation plays a highly important role in the COVID-19 response efforts. Proactive cooperation with epidemiological investigation is essential to preventing/controlling transmission of the disease. Giving false statement or testimony, submitting false information, or deliberately omitting or concealing facts during epidemiological investigation is punishable by imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to 20 million won in accordance with Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act.
 
○ Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters has designated convalescent hospitals, mental health hospitals (closed wards), nursing homes, and churches/religious facilities as high-risk communities and proposed plans for management of such communities.
- These communities have a high proportion of elderly people and/or people with underlying (preexisting) conditions who may not recover easily if infected with COVID-19. They are also more likely to stay long in closed indoor spaces, putting them at high risk of infection.
- The authorities will require such communities to designate an infection prevention/control manager, who will set up an emergency contact system within the group and manage infection prevention/control measures within the facility.
- The infection prevention/control manager will be required to regularly check body temperature and for presence of respiratory symptoms of workers, patients, residents, attendees, members and/or participants (depending on the type of community).
- Control measures for visitors should also be implemented, such as checking for fever or respiratory symptoms and making a log of visitors.
- If a patient or resident is found with a fever or respiratory symptoms, they should immediately be reported to public health center. The symptomatic patient/resident should be isolated in a separate space. If a worker/visitor/participant is found with a fever or respiratory symptoms, they should be prohibited from entering the facility and should be reported to public health center.
- The community is expected to cooperate with testing of symptomatic persons in the community. It should set up and maintain a thorough emergency contact system in close relationship with relevant departments in the local government, public health center, fire department, screening clinic, and healthcare facilities at all times.
- If a worker has recently returned from an overseas trip or is a family member of a confirmed case or a person under home quarantine, the infection prevention/control manager is responsible for excluding said person from work for a certain period of time.
- The detailed plans for stronger infectious disease prevention and control management for high-risk communities will be prepared by Friday, 10 April, and will begin to take effect starting Saturday, 11 April.
 
○ Starting 1 April, Korean government is requiring all inbound travelers who boarded from overseas to mandatory quarantine for 2 weeks. 
Persons under home quarantine (self-quarantine) are required to follow the self-quarantine guidelines provided. They must not share their utensils, towels and other personal belongings with their family, refrain from coming in contact with family members, roommates, or cohabitants.
 
○ Starting 5 April, stronger penalty is applied to persons who violate mandatory home quarantine (self-quarantine). Failure to comply with mandatory home quarantine is punishable by imprisonment up to 1 year or a fine up to 10 million won in accordance with Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act. 
 
○ KCDC asked people for continued participation in the Enhanced Social Distancing campaign which has been extended to 19 April. KCDC is advising people to refrain from activities that make it easy to come in close contact with other people in an enclosed space and to maintain good personal hygiene including washing hands and covering coughs/sneezes.
 




Call to actions for all citizens
 
 ① Cancel or postpone all non-essential gatherings, dining out, social events, and travel plans.
 * There have been numerous reports overseas of transmission by eating together. All meetings and events involving sharing a meal should especially be postponed or canceled.
 
 ② If you have fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, or other respiratory symptoms, do not go to work. Stay home and get sufficient rest.
 
 ③ Avoid leaving home except to purchase necessities, to get medical care, or to go to work.
 
 ④ Avoid handshakes and other forms of physical contact. Keep a 2-meter distance from each other.
 
 ⑤ Wash your hands, cover up your sneezes/coughs, and generally maintain strict personal hygiene.
 
 ⑥ Disinfect and ventilate your space every day.
