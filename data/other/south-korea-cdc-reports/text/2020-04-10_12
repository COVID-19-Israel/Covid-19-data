  * Figures may change based on findings from ongoing local epidemiological investigation efforts.
 
○ Epidemiological links have been found for 81.8% of the total cases; 9.8% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 2.
 
○ One of the cases confirmed on 8 April has been found to be linked to the bar Liquid Soul in Seocho-gu, Seoul. In total, 5 cases have been confirmed from Liquid Soul since 6 April.
 
○ From the wine bar UnWined in Pyeongtaek City, Gyeonggi Province, 1 additional case has been confirmed, bringing the total to 18 confirmed cases (wine bar = 14; family/acquaintances of confirmed cases = 4). Further epidemiological investigation is underway.
 
○ From Gyeongbuk Province, during the epidemiological investigation (and testing) on a new case, 3 family members and 1 co-worker have been found confirmed with COVID-19. Further investigation into chains of transmission and contacts is underway. (The figures on Table 2 are based on cases reported to KCDC before 0:00 of 10 April and may differ from above.)
 
○ KCDC is investigating the epidemiological and/or clinical characteristics of 91 cases that have re-tested positive after being discharged from isolation.
 - From Pureun Nursing Home in Gyeongbuk Province, 11 additional cases re-tested positive after being discharged from isolation since 6 April. (In total, 18 out of 36 discharged confirmed cases from this cluster have re-tested positive). Central and local rapid response teams are conducting joint, in-depth investigations (including virus isolation culture, blood antibody test) to confirm infectivity.
 
○ In light of the continued emergence of imported cases, KCDC urged all inbound travelers who boarded from overseas to comply with home quarantine guidelines. 
 - Persons under home quarantine (self-quarantine) are required to follow the quarantine guidelines provided. They must not share their utensils, towels and other personal belongings with their family, refrain from coming in contact with family members, roommates, or cohabitants.

Failure to comply with mandatory home quarantine is punishable by imprisonment up to 1 year or a fine up to 10 million won in accordance with Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act. 
 
○ KCDC asked people for continued participation in the Enhanced Social Distancing campaign which has been extended to 19 April. KCDC is advising people to refrain from activities that make it easy to come in close contact with other people in an enclosed space and to maintain good personal hygiene including washing hands and covering coughs/sneezes.
 - KCDC thanked religious communities that have chosen to actively participate in voluntary social distancing including postponing gatherings or hosting online worship services for upcoming Easter celebration on 12 April.
 - KCDC also urged religious communities to strictly follow the infection prevention guidelines such as mask wearing, fever checks, and distancing if gathering in person.
 
○ In light of the increase in the cases of COVID-19 infection from nightlife venues, young people are advised to practice caution and remember that any environment that makes it easy to come in close contact with other people poses a high risk of infection.
 
○ Citizens who participate in early voting (10-11 April) are advised to follow the infection prevention guidelines provided.
