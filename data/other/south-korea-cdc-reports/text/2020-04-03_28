 * Figures may change based on findings from ongoing local epidemiological investigation efforts.
 
 
 
○ All inbound travelers entering Korea are required to undergo temperature checks and submit health condition questionnaire. 
 
○ All symptomatic inbound travelers will be tested and wait for the results in airport quarantine station. Persons who test positive will be transferred to hospital or living treatment center. Persons who test negative will be required to home quarantine for 14 days. 
 
○ All asymptomatic inbound travelers will be required to home quarantine for 14 days. Foreigners on short-term visits (who do not have a home in Korea) will be quarantined at facility. Foreigners who boarded from Europe will be tested at airport.
 
○ Persons arriving from overseas should return home straight after arriving at the airport. They should travel in their own vehicle or designated airport limousine bus or designated KTX train (reserved specifically for this purpose). They are required to sanitize their hands and wear a facemask during movement.
 
○ The persons under self-quarantine (home quarantine) are required to follow the self-quarantine guidelines provided. They must not share their utensils, towels and other personal belongings with their family, refrain from coming in contact with family members, roommates, or cohabitants. Family members, roommates, or cohabitants should wear a facemask and keep 2 meter distance from the person under self-quarantine, ventilate the living space frequently, and clean all frequently touched surfaces often. If they notice suspected symptoms develop (fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, shortness of breath, etc.) they must contact the designated public official or use the self-quarantine app to notify their symptoms and be tested. 
 
○ The Korean government is promoting the Enhanced Social Distancing campaign from 22 March to 5 April. In light of the recent outbreaks related to religious events, the KCDC asked people to practice extra precaution in relation to religious events this weekend.
 
○ For example, although Manmin Central Church in Seoul moved to online livestreamed service since 6 March, 400 contacts emerged from people who were working to prepare/facilitate online worship, 41 of whom (10%) were confirmed with COVID-19. Also from around 140 contacts, 4 were confirmed.
 
○ From Kyuam Church in Chungnam Province (which still continued to gather for Sunday service despite social distancing recommendations), 7 members have been confirmed.
 
○ KCDC advised people to stay home as much as possible during the weekend, refrain from engaging in activities that make it easy to come in close contact with other people in an enclosed space, and maintain good personal hygiene including washing hands and covering coughs/sneezes.





Call to actions for all citizens
 
 ① Cancel or postpone all non-essential gatherings, dining out, social events, and travel plans.
 * There have been numerous reports overseas of transmission by eating together. All meetings and events involving sharing a meal should especially be postponed or canceled.
 
 ② If you have fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, or other respiratory symptoms, do not go to work. Stay home and get sufficient rest.
 
 ③ Avoid leaving home except to purchase necessities, to get medical care, or to go to work.
 
 ④ Avoid handshakes and other forms of physical contact. Keep a 2-meter distance from each other.
 
 ⑤ Wash your hands, cover up your sneezes/coughs, and generally maintain strict personal hygiene.
 
 ⑥ Disinfect and ventilate your space every day.
