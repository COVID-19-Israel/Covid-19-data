○ Epidemiological links have been found for 80.6% of the total cases; 19.4% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 1 on the next page. Distribution of the cases by sex and age groups are as indicated in Table 2. A graph of imported cases by period and region of origin is provided in Figure 1.
 
○ Five additional confirmed cases have been reported from the call center located in Guro-gu, Seoul, amounting to a current total of 134 confirmed cases from the call center since 8 March. Investigations of the confirmed cases who are onset of symptom at the end of February revealed that they are not Shincheonji members, have no recent history of overseas travel, and have no known link to other confirmed cases.
 
○ A current total of 47 confirmed cases have been reported from a church (Grace River Church) in Gyeonggi Province since 9 March. Further investigation and contact tracing are underway.
 
○ The KCDC released the data it has collected on the characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 cases (patients aged 18 years old or younger). A total of 352 confirmed pediatric cases have been reported, among whom 56 have been discharged and 296 are currently in isolation. Discharge rate for pediatric patients is 15.9%, compared to 16.8% for all ages. There has been no fatalities. No severe cases occurred. Further detailed analysis of pediatric cases is underway. More data will be made available as soon as the analysis is completed. 
 
○ In light of the recent rise in the number of confirmed cases from airport quarantine, the KCDC announced that the Special Entry Procedure will be extended to all travelers arriving at port beginning at 0:00 of 19 March. The Special Entry Procedure requires the traveler to be checked for fever, provide a confirmed contact information at port entry, and report their symptoms daily for the next 14 days via self-health check mobile app. Travel history of all travelers entering Korea will be provided to healthcare providers via the International Traveler Information System for reference. 
 
○ Travelers who have visited Europe, the U.S., or Asia in the past 14 days are advised to minimize movement, adhere to social distancing personal hygiene measures, since infected persons with mild symptoms in initial stages of the disease may unknowingly transmit the virus to other people. 
 
○ The KCDC will be having a conference meeting with WHO clinical team/COVID-19 advisors, representatives of relevant institutions, and domestic experts and researchers. This meeting, initiated by WHO who expressed interest in participating in the COVID-19 cohort research by domestic healthcare professionals, is expected to be helpful in developing future strategies for responding to the global pandemic.
 
○ The KCDC again reminded everyone that personal hygiene and social distancing practices are effective measures to prevent infections.
