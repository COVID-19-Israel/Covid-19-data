  * Figures may change based on findings from ongoing local epidemiological investigation efforts.
 
○ Epidemiological links have been found for 81.4% of the total cases; 9.7% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 3.
 
○ From Second Mi-Ju Hospital in Daegu City, 2 additional cases (patients) were confirmed from the testing of all 137 persons (patients and staff/workers) under cohort isolation. In total, 193 cases (patients = 179; staff/workers = 14) have been confirmed since 26 March. 
 
○ From Euijeongbu St. Mary’s Hospital in Gyeonggi Province, 2 additional cases (patients = 2) were confirmed while under quarantine. In total, 64 cases (patients = 24; staff/workers = 16; family/guardians/other contacts = 24) have been confirmed since 29 March.
 
○ From Yecheon-gun, Gyeongbuk Province, 11 additional cases were confirmed during investigation of contacts. In total, 25 cases (including 1 in Mungyeong City) have been confirmed since 9 April. 
(The figures in Table 3 are based on cases reported to KCDC before 0:00 of 14 April and may differ from above.)
 
○ In light of the fact that 52.3% of new cases during the last 2 weeks were imported cases, KCDC urged all inbound travelers who boarded from overseas to comply with home quarantine guidelines. 
 - Persons under home quarantine (self-quarantine) are required to follow the quarantine guidelines provided. They must not share their utensils, towels and other personal belongings with their family, roommates, or cohabitants. They must also refrain from coming in contact with family members, roommates, or cohabitants.
 - Family members, roommates, or cohabitants must not share their personal items with the person under quarantine. They should also frequently wipe and clean all frequently touched surfaces and avoid coming in contact with the person under quarantine as much as possible.
  
○ Korean government plans to set up an intergovernmental task force to support the development of treatment and vaccines for COVID-19.
 - The intergovernmental task force, which will be co-directed by the Minister of Health and Welfare and the Minister of Science and ICT and consist of members from other related ministries and private sector experts, will watch the progress in the development of treatment and vaccines and identify the challenges in the area and develop support measures accordingly.
 - A working-level task force will be co-headed by the Director of National Institute of Health and the Deputy Minister of R&D Policy (of Ministry of Science and ICT). Industry, academia, research, and clinical experts will participate in the task force for regular collaboration in the areas of treatment, vaccine, and infection prevention/control supplies.
 
○ KCDC asked voters to carefully follow the infection prevention guidelines when casting their votes for the general election tomorrow (15 April).
 - Voters should wash their hands thoroughly before and after going to polling places, wear a facemask at polling stations, and keep a distance of at least 1 meter from other voters.
 - At the entrance to the polling station, voters will undergo temperature checks, disinfect their hands with hand sanitizer, and put on disposable gloves. Voters should comply with the instructions of poll workers.
 - Marking one’s hand or finger inside the polling booth with the stamp used to fill out the ballot (something many Korean voters have been doing in recent elections to casually display their pride in exercising their right to vote) is not recommended for this election due to infection prevention reasons.

○ For the upcoming holiday (Election Day) tomorrow, KCDC asked people to continue to participate in the Enhanced Social Distancing and refrain from non-essential gatherings, dining out, or travel.
