○ K-NIH has established a test (Immunofluorescence Assay, IFA) to examine the human body’s immunological response on the blood obtained from COVID-19 patients. K-NIH plans to accelerate the development of related therapeutics based on the development of a probe to detect COVID-19 antibody.
 
○ KCDC urges to local government to cooperate with facilities as cases are confirmed around group facilities, multi-use facilities, and medical centers. Also KCDC recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, and social distancing to avoid population crowding or cancel/suspend gathering activities.
