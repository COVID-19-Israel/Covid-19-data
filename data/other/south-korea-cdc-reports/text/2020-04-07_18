* Figures may change based on findings from ongoing local epidemiological investigation efforts.
 
 
○ Epidemiological links have been found for 82.3% of the total cases; 9.9% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 2.
 
○ From Uijeongbu St. Mary’s Hospital in Gyeonggi Province, 4 additional cases were confirmed during home quarantine. In total, 48 cases (patients = 18; staff/workers = 14; family/visitors/other contacts = 16) have been confirmed since 29 March.
 
○ From Second Mi-Ju Hospital in Daegu City, 11 additional cases were confirmed from the testing of 159 persons (patients and staff) in cohort isolation. In total, 185 cases (patients = 171; staff/workers = 14) have been confirmed since 26 March.
 
○ On 5 April, from Daegu Medical Center, 1 nurse working with confirmed patient was confirmed with COVID-19. Investigation into contacts and other disease control/prevention measures are underway. KCDC will continue its effort to ensure a safer working environment for healthcare workers in the front line. (The figures on Table 2 are based on cases reported to KCDC before 0:00 of 7 April and may differ from above.)
 
○ KCDC’s National Institute of Health plans to conduct analysis of defense ability and others through serum epidemiology studies such as COVID-19 antibody testing. It is also working on COVID-19 vaccine development including production of VLP candidate substances.
Virus-like particles (VLP) are particles composed only of structural proteins without genetic material; they are a type of vaccine that induces immune response without viral replication.
 
○ Starting 1 April, Korean government is requiring all inbound travelers who boarded from overseas to mandatory quarantine for 2 weeks. 
Persons under home quarantine (self-quarantine) are required to follow the self-quarantine guidelines provided. They must not share their utensils, towels and other personal belongings with their family, refrain from coming in contact with family members, roommates, or cohabitants.
 
○ Starting 5 April, stronger penalty is applied to persons who violate mandatory home quarantine (self-quarantine). Failure to comply with mandatory home quarantine is punishable by imprisonment up to 1 year or a fine up to 10 million won in accordance with Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act. 
 
○ KCDC asked people for continued participation in the Enhanced Social Distancing campaign which has been extended to 19 April. KCDC is advising people to refrain from activities that make it easy to come in close contact with other people in an enclosed space and to maintain good personal hygiene including washing hands and covering coughs/sneezes.
 




Call to actions for all citizens
 
 ① Cancel or postpone all non-essential gatherings, dining out, social events, and travel plans.
 * There have been numerous reports overseas of transmission by eating together. All meetings and events involving sharing a meal should especially be postponed or canceled.
 
 ② If you have fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, or other respiratory symptoms, do not go to work. Stay home and get sufficient rest.
 
 ③ Avoid leaving home except to purchase necessities, to get medical care, or to go to work.
 
 ④ Avoid handshakes and other forms of physical contact. Keep a 2-meter distance from each other.
 
 ⑤ Wash your hands, cover up your sneezes/coughs, and generally maintain strict personal hygiene.
 
 ⑥ Disinfect and ventilate your space every day.



 
 

○ Today, KCDC (and Central Disease Control Headquarters) staff observed the World Health Day (7 April) by taking a moment of silence to commemorate those who died fighting COVID-19. KCDC also thanked all healthcare and public health workers who are working in the front line for COVID-19 response. KCDC will continue to respond to COVID-19 with best efforts.
