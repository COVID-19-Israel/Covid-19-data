  * Figures may change based on findings from ongoing local epidemiological investigation efforts.
 
  
○ Epidemiological links have been found for 81.3% of the total cases; 9.6% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 3.
 
○ From Love Tree Clinic in Daegu City, 1 case (a discharged patient of the clinic) was confirmed on 12 April. Upon investigation into contacts, 2 additional cases (who worked in the clinic) were confirmed. Further epidemiological investigation is underway. 
 
○ From Euijeongbu St. Mary’s Hospital in Gyeonggi Province, 5 additional cases (patients = 2; staff/worker = 1; family/guardians/other contacts = 2) were confirmed while under quarantine. In total, 69 cases (patients = 26; staff/workers = 17; family/guardians/other contacts = 26) have been confirmed since 29 March.
 
○ From Yecheon-gun, Gyeongbuk Province, 6 additional cases were confirmed during investigation of contacts. In total, 31 cases (including 2 in Andong City and 1 in Mungyeong City) have been confirmed since 9 April. 
(The figures in Table 3 are based on cases reported to KCDC before 0:00 of 16 April and may differ from above.)
 
○ KCDC published the results of its evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity through blood and excrement (urine, stool) culture tests from COVID-19 patients.
 - From culture testing of the 24 samples from which SARS-CoV-2 gene was detected (out of a total of 699 serum, urine, and stool samples obtained from 74 patients), no isolated virus was found. This means that it is highly unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through a path other than the respiratory system.
 - (More details provided in a separate press release*) (*English translation may not be available)
 
○ KCDC’s National Institute of Health announced its plans to participate in domestic clinical trials of COVID-19 DNA vaccine candidate in cooperation with other organizations including the International Vaccine Institute.
 - Clinical trials (phases I and II) will be conducted in Korea using Inovio’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate (INO-4800), which is under clinical trial in the US since 6 April.
 
○ Also, an intergovernmental working-level task force on COVID-19 in private-public partnership will launch and have its first meeting on Friday, 17 April.
 - The working-level task force, co-headed by the Director of National Institute of Health (of KCDC) and the Deputy Minister of R&D Policy (of Ministry of Science and ICT), will support the intergovernmental (high-level) task force in analyzing the entire life cycle of COVID-19 response including research and development, production, national stockpiling, and utilization of COVID-19 treatment, vaccine, infection prevention/control equipment and identifying the challenges on site to develop support measures accordingly.
 - (More details in separate inter-governmental joint press release**) (**English translation may not be available)
 
○ Although the number of confirmed cases has seen a decline recently, there is still a risk of large-scale outbreak from close contact in enclosed environment if social distancing is loosened. KCDC urged everyone to continue to follow social distancing and personal hygiene guidelines.
 - KCDC stressed that reducing contact with other people as much as possible, washing hands thoroughly, and if having suspected symptoms, refraining from going to work or leaving home and going to a screening clinic to get tested are the most important and effective measures against COVID-19.
 - People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded place should keep at least 2 meters of distance from other people, wear a facemask, and maintain hand hygiene by washing hands or using hand sanitizers.
 
○ KCDC urged young people to avoid enclosed spaces such as nightclubs, bars, and cafes and to refrain from social gatherings that may involve coming in close contact with other people.
 




 
Call to actions for all citizens
 
 
 ① Cancel or postpone all non-essential gatherings, dining out, social events, and travel plans.
    * There have been numerous reports overseas of transmission by eating together. All meetings and events involving sharing a meal should especially be postponed or canceled.
 
 ② If you have fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, or other respiratory symptoms, do not go to work. Stay home and get sufficient rest.
 
 ③ Avoid leaving home except to purchase necessities, to get medical care, or to go to work.
 
 ④ Avoid handshakes and other forms of physical contact. Keep a 2-meter distance from each other.
 
 ⑤ Wash your hands, cover up your sneezes/coughs, and generally maintain strict personal hygiene.
 
 ⑥ Disinfect and ventilate your space every day.
