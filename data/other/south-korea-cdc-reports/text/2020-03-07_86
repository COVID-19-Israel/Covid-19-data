○ 72.8% of the total cases have epidemiological links and 27.2% are either under investigation or individual cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each region or city are shown in the Table 1 below. Distribution of the cases by sex and age groups are as indicated in Table 2.

○ Considering that the transmission spreads from community facilities, KCDC advised to designate a reporting person at every community facility so that suspected cases could be immediately reported to the local government and public health authority upon the onset of symptoms. The staff at the facilities should strictly follow personal hygiene practice, avoid going out when having fever or respiratory symptoms, and monitor the symptoms for 3-4 days.
