○ Epidemiological links have been found for 80.4% of the total cases; 19.6% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 2.
 
○ From Guro-gu call center in Seoul, 2 additional cases (2 contacts under self-quarantine) were confirmed. The current total is 158 confirmed cases since 8 March. (11th floor = 94; 10th floor = 2; 9th floor = 1; contacts = 61)
 
○ From Hyosarang Nursing Home in Gyeonggi Province, 8 additional cases (resident at the facility = 5; staff = 3) were confirmed while under quarantine. The current total is 14 confirmed cases since 19 March. (Residents = 10; staff = 4)
 
○ In Daegu, testing has been completed for every person at high-risk facilities. On 23 March, 14 additional cases were confirmed from 3 convalescent hospitals.
 
○ Starting 22 March, the KCDC is conducting COVID-19 diagnostic testing for every inbound traveler entering from Europe. Yesterday (23 March), of the 1,203 inbound travelers from Europe, 101 were symptomatic and 1,102 were asymptomatic. For more efficient use of quarantine resources, starting 14:00 today, asymptomatic travelers who are Korean nationals (with domestic residence) will be directed to go into self-quarantine at home and get tested at their local public health center within 3 days of arrival (rather than getting tested at quarantine facility before going home for self-quarantine). Foreigners will be quarantined at facility and tested. Persons staying long-term who test negative will go into self-quarantine at home for 14 days. 
 
○ Short-term travelers will be subject to active monitoring. Symptomatic persons will be tested at airport as before. Persons who test positive will be admitted to hospital or isolation facility depending on the severity level assessed for each case. Travel histories of all inbound travelers will be provided to healthcare providers via the International Traveler Information System (DUR/ITS) for reference.
 
○ Noting that 22 of the 76 (21.9%) new confirmed cases are imported cases, the KCDC urged international travelers to practice extra caution and care. The KCDC strongly recommended that all non-urgent international travel plans be canceled or postponed. Persons who are unable to avoid traveling for a critical reason are advised to refrain from visiting any enclosed facilities or healthcare facilities. Upon entering Korea, they should voluntarily disclose any symptoms and their international travel history and follow appropriate guidelines and instructions, including minimizing movement and physical interpersonal contact for 14 days. 
 
○ Any person who suspect onset of COVID-19 symptoms are advised to call the KCDC call center (1339) or local call centers (area code + 120), ask a local public health center, or visit a screening facility, before visiting a regular healthcare provider directly. All persons who visit a screening center should arrive wearing a mask and in their own car if possible, and disclose their international travel history to the healthcare professionals. 
 
○ The KCDC also advised employers to ensure that employees returning from international business trips do not return to their office for the first 2 weeks upon their return.
 
○ The KNIH is currently working on developing antibody treatment and conducting a study in collaboration with private and public sector institutions.
 
○ In light of the continued emergence of outbreaks in various venues such as religious facilities and workplaces, the KCDC urged everyone to participate in enhanced social distancing campaign for the next 15 days (22 March – 5 April). Citizens are advised to stay home as much as possible other than for going to work, visiting a healthcare provider, and purchasing necessities. Working citizens are asked to maintain a distance during lunch breaks, refrain from using break rooms and other social venues, and pay closer attention to maintaining personal hygiene (e.g. washing hands). 
 
○ Employers are advised to implement various methods of minimizing person-to-person contact for employees, such as work-from-home and flexible hours systems. Those who show symptoms should be advised not to show up at work. Workers who develop symptoms mid-day should be sent home immediately. The government ordered limited operation of high-risk facilities including religious facilities, some indoor fitness facilities, and nightlife venues. Venues that remain in operation must strictly comply with infection prevention guidelines (e.g. disinfecting, ventilation, distancing, mask wearing) set by the authorities.
