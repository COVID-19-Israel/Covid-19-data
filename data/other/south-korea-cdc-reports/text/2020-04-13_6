  * Figures may change based on findings from ongoing local epidemiological investigation efforts.
 
○ Epidemiological links have been found for 81.5% of the total cases; 9.7% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 2.
 
○ From Second Mi-Ju Hospital in Daegu City, 1 additional case (patient) was confirmed from the testing of all 137 persons (patients and staff/workers) under cohort isolation. In total, 191 cases (patients = 177; staff/workers = 14) have been confirmed since 26 March. 
 
○ From Euijeongbu St. Mary’s Hospital in Gyeonggi Province, 3 additional cases (patient = 1; family/guardian of patient = 1; other contact = 1) were confirmed. In total, 62 cases (patients = 22; staff/workers = 16; family/guardians/other contacts = 24) have been confirmed since 29 March.
 
○ From Yecheon-gun, Gyeongbuk Province, 3 additional cases were confirmed during investigation of contacts. In total, 14 cases have been confirmed since 9 April. 
(The figures in Table 2 are based on cases reported to KCDC before 0:00 of 13 April and may differ from above.)
 
○ In light of the continued emergence of imported cases and transmission from imported cases, KCDC urged all inbound travelers who boarded from overseas to comply with home quarantine guidelines. 
Persons under home quarantine (self-quarantine) are required to follow the quarantine guidelines provided. They must not share their utensils, towels and other personal belongings with their family, roommates, or cohabitants and refrain from coming in contact with family members, roommates, or cohabitants.
Family members, roommates, or cohabitants must not share their personal items with the person under quarantine. They should also frequently wipe and clean all frequently touched surfaces and avoid coming in contact with the person under quarantine as much as possible.
 
○ Although the number of confirmed cases has seen a decline recently, there is still a risk of large-scale outbreak from close contact in enclosed environment if social distancing is loosened. 
KCDC noted that a large-scale outbreak may cause collapse of the healthcare system and cause the number of deaths in high-risk groups to increase at any time and urged people to continue to follow social distancing and personal hygiene guidelines.
Many people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have symptoms so mild that they may not even realize that they are infected, even though the disease is highly contagious in early stages of infection. Therefore, it is highly important that all citizens continue to carefully follow the call to actions (provided below).
KCDC stressed that reducing contact with other people as much as possible, washing hands thoroughly, wearing masks when visiting an enclosed/crowded place, and if having suspected symptoms, refraining from going to work or leaving home and going to a screening clinic to get tested are the most important and effective measures against COVID-19.
 
○ KCDC urged young people to avoid enclosed spaces such as nightclubs, bars, and cafes and to refrain from social gatherings that may involve coming in close contact with other people.
 
○ KCDC noted the possibility that more transmission may have occurred during last weekend due to increased contact between people from early voting and Easter celebrations. Therefore, early detection of infected persons this week is important. KCDC asked healthcare workers to help detect patients at early stages by aggressively testing persons who are suspected to be infected with COVID-19.
