* Not classified into a cluster or under investigation
** Confirmed from 9:00, 27 February to 9:00 28 February
※ The interim classification is based on the reporting location, which may change depending on further epidemiological investigation.




○ As of 28 February, 63 cases have been confirmed in Busan, 32 of which are related to Onchun Church.

○ In Gyeong-buk province, confirmed cases were reported mainly in community centers and shelters (Milal Shelter, Kukrak Community Shelter, and Seorin Nursing Home). The cases under investigation are presumably to be linked with Shincheonji cluster. There are three more staff at Cheongdo Daenam Hospital confirmed positive while in isolation, which brings the total number of the cases in the cluster to 117.

○ In Chung-nam province, 16 cases were confirmed in total as of today, most of which were reported from the gym in Cheonan. One patient admitted at Gongju Medical Center from 20 to 25 February was confirmed, so other in-patients and staff with contact history are currently under isolation. The additional investigation is underway.

○ KCDC is planning to provide the health facilities located in the special management regions with a specialized training session for Infection Prevention and Control (IPC), such as a proper way to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and a referral guideline for the confirmed case.

○ Furthermore, KCDC has been providing COVID-19 virus to research institutes, medical schools, and non-private sectors for vaccine and treatment development. This will be expanded even more to accelerate research and development on COVID-19.
