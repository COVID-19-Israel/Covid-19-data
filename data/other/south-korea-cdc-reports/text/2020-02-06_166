○ The 17th case, a 37-year-old Korean male, has 188 contacts. All the contacts are closely monitored. After the onset of symptoms, he visited health facilities and restaurants. Other places he visited and additional contacts he might have are currently being investigated.
 
○ The 20th case, a 41-year-old Korean female, is a family member of the 15th case. While in self-quarantine, she experienced discomfort in her throat and visited a triage health center. On 5 February, she was confirmed positive.

○ The 23rd case, a 58-year-old Chinese female, visited Korea from Wuhan for a travel on 23 January. She was one of the people, a subject of screening and monitoring due to a travel history. Since the address and contact number of the case were unknown, KCDC tracked her location in cooperation with the National Police Agency. KCDC has also informed local governments of a list of the people coming from Wuhan from 13 to 26 January for monitoring. 
 
○ KCDC updates the response guideline, including the expansion of case definition, effective of 7 February, 2020. According to the new case definition, the suspected case is anyone who develops fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days after returning from China or who is suspected of 2019-nCoV by clinicians based on a travel history. 
○ KCDC also cooperates with the Ministry of Science and ICT and the Ministry of the Interior and Safety for research on 2019-nCoV infection. The research would be about developing rapid diagnostics and exploring effective treatment options, and it is expected to start within this month.
 
○ Finally, KCDC advises the public to avoid crowded areas, wash hands, and wear masks when travelling to South-East Asia, given that there are cases confirmed after returning from South-East Asia. Furthermore, when they return to Korea, it is recommended to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities and monitor themselves for fever or respiratory symptoms for 14 days.
