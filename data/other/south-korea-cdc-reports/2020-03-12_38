* Not classified into a cluster or under investigation
 
※ The interim classification is based on the reporting location, which may change depending on further epidemiological investigation.
 



○ A current total of 99 confirmed cases have been reported from a call center in Guro-gu since the 8th of March. Epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are underway. Out of 208 workers at the call center on the 11th floor, 80 cases are confirmed. Self-quarantine measures have been taken by 553 workers who work on 7th through 9th floors of the same building. 

○ World Health Organization, Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced on 11 March that WHO has “made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic”, effectively declaring the status of the COVID-19 outbreak as a global pandemic.
 
○ KCDC said it will maintain its current dual focus on containment and mitigation and will further strengthen the response strategy as informed by the domestic and international status. 
 
○ In light of the recent rise in case clusters from closed spaces including gym facilities and call centers, “Guidelines for intense management of business entities* for COVID-19 prevention” have been created by Korea’s public health authorities. (*includes call centers, Internet cafes, gyms, religious gatherings, private academies, etc.)
 
○ To prevent further imported cases, special immigration procedures will be expanded to the European region in response to the recent rapid increase of local transmission. The procedures will begin to take effect at 0:00 of 15 March for all Korean and international travelers arriving after having visited or lived in France, Germany, Spain, the U.K. or the Netherlands.

 
○ KCDC urged everyone to keep strict adherence to personal hygiene and social distancing measures, including covering sneezes and coughs with arm sleeves to prevent transmission via respiratory droplets and refraining from visiting closed community spaces or public gatherings.
 
○ KCDC also encouraged businesses and workplaces to adopt remote working environments for employees such as work-at-home and online collaboration.
 
○ Extra care should be taken to keep clean any frequently used surfaces in living spaces. Individuals with fever and respiratory symptoms should refrain from leaving home including going to work or school and watch the symptoms for the next 3-4 days.
 
○ Confirmed cases by date, by region, by gender and age are shown in the following graph and tables.
