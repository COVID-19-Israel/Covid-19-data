* Not classified into a cluster or under investigation
※ The interim classification is based on the reporting location, which may change depending on further epidemiological investigation.



 
 
○ All inbound travelers from Europe are tested effective of 0:00, 22 March. Furthermore, even if tested negative, Korean citizens and long-term stay foreigners should be under self-quarantine for 14 days, and short-term visitors should be under active monitoring. 
 
○ Anyone having respiratory symptoms at the point of entry or epidemiological links with confirmed cases will be quarantines for testing at quarantine station. The inbound travelers with no symptoms will stay at temporary support facilities by getting the result of test. 
 
○ In light of the continued emergence of outbreaks in religious group, and other facilities, the KCDC stresses the public to strictly comply with social distancing from 22 March to 5 April for 15days before opening the school. The KCDC urged the public to stay at home excluding necessary reason like purchasing daily necessity, visiting at health facilities, and commuting. 
 
○ Korean government will restrict the operation of some facilities, such as religious facilities, indoor sports, and entertainment facilities which are at high risk of infection. Inevitably, when operating, it is necessary to strictly follow the guideline set by the KCDC, such as disinfection and ventilation, social distancing, and wearing a mask.
