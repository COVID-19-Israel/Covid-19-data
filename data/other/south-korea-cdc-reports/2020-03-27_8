○ Epidemiological links have been found for 81.8% of the total cases; 14.9% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 2.
 
○ From the call center building in Guro-gu, Seoul, 3 additional cases were confirmed. All three additional cases are contacts related to a church (SaengMyeongSu Church) which a confirmed case (11th floor) visited. The current total is 163 confirmed cases since 8 March. Of the 163 confirmed cases, 97 are persons who worked in the building (11th floor = 94; 10th floor = 2; 9th floor = 1), and 66 are their contacts. 
 
○ From Second Mi-Ju Hospital in Daegu, 1 inpatient was confirmed with COVID-19 on 26 March, prompting testing of 355 persons (staff = 72; patients = 286), of which 61 (patients = 60; caregiver = 1) were confirmed. In total, 62 cases have been confirmed. Since this hospital is located in the same building as Daesil Convalescent Hospital (which had already produced many cases), all staff had already been tested and their results returned negative on 21 March. However, 1 inpatient began displaying symptoms which prompted testing and the case was confirmed. Investigation into contacts and the chain of transmission are underway. (The figures may differ from those in Table 2 as the figures in the table are based on cases reported to the KCDC before 0:00 of 27 March.)
 
○ Due to the rise in the percentage of imported cases, screening at port entry and strict monitoring of self-quarantine is becoming important.
 
○ Since 22 March, every inbound traveler from Europe is required to be tested. Starting 0:00 of 27 March, a stronger screening process will be applied for inbound travelers from the United States. All symptomatic persons entering from the US, regardless of nationality, will be required to wait for testing in a facility within the airport. Persons who test positive will be transferred to a hospital or “Living Treatment Center”. Persons who test negative will enter self-quarantine at home for 14 days. Korean nationals and foreigners with a domestic residence who are asymptomatic at the time of entry will enter self-quarantine in their home for 14 days and get tested if symptoms begin to occur. Foreigners who are on a short-term visit (without domestic residence and thus are unable to self-quarantine) will be tested in at a temporary facility. If they test negative, they will be allowed entry under enhanced active monitoring. Inbound travelers who are subject to self-quarantine are required to install an app on their phone at the point of entry. They will check and report their symptoms on the app, and their self-quarantine will be monitored by location tracking through the app. The authorities will consider whether to begin requiring every inbound traveler from the US to be tested if it becomes necessary in the future based on whether the situation worsens in regards to COVID-19 transmission in the United States and the number of imported cases from the US.
 
○ The KCDC urged all inbound travelers to follow the precautionary measures, including not leaving home for 14 days, minimizing contact with other people, not going to work, washing hands, covering sneezes and coughs. Persons entering from Europe or the US should return home straight after arriving at the airport, refrain from using public transportation, travel in their own vehicle, and wear a facemask during movement. Beginning 28 March, airport limousine bus or KTX train will be provided for inbound travelers without access to their own vehicle. During the self-quarantine period, the person under self-quarantine should not share their utensils, towels and other personal belongings with their family, refrain from coming in contact with family members, roommates, or cohabitants. (Self-quarantine guidelines are provided to those subject to self-quarantine.) If they notice symptoms develop (fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, shortness of breath, etc.), they should contact the designated public official or use the self-quarantine app to notify their symptoms and go to a screening center to be tested. Failure to comply with self-quarantine guidelines is punishable by imprisonment up to 1 year or a fine up to 10 million won. Persons entering from places other than Europe or US are also advised to stay at home for 14 days and minimize contact with other people.
 
○ Any person who suspect onset of COVID-19 symptoms are advised to call the KCDC call center (1339) or local call centers (area code + 120), ask a local public health center, or visit a screening facility, before visiting a regular healthcare provider directly. All persons who visit a screening center should arrive wearing a mask and in their own car if possible, and disclose their international travel history to the healthcare professionals. 
 
○ The KCDC also advised employers to ensure that employees returning from international business trips will not return to their office for the first 2 weeks upon their return. In particular, employers should especially ensure that employees working at publicly used venues who have international travel history are required to work from home or take a short leave.
 
○ The Korean government is promoting the Enhanced Social Distancing campaign from 22 March to 5 April. The KCDC thanked Korean people for their active participation and support for the campaign which has allowed the authorities to continue their disease control efforts without a surge in local transmission. It also urged people to refrain from religious gathering, going to indoor fitness or sports facilities, or other activities that make it easy to come in close contact with other people in an enclosed space during the weekend.





Call to actions for all citizens
 
 ① Cancel or postpone all non-essential gatherings, dining out, social events, and travel plans.
     * There have been numerous reports overseas of transmission by eating together. All meetings and events involving sharing a meal should especially be postponed or canceled.
 
 ② If you have fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, or other respiratory symptoms, do not go to work. Stay home and get sufficient rest.
 
 ③ Avoid leaving home except to purchase necessities, to get medical care, or to go to work.
 
 ④ Avoid handshakes and other forms of physical contact. Keep a 2-meter distance from each other.
 
 ⑤ Wash your hands, cover up your sneezes/coughs, and generally maintain strict personal hygiene.
 
 ⑥ Disinfect and ventilate your space every day.



 
○ Acknowledging the public anxiety and feelings of depression experienced by many people due to the prolonged outbreak and social distancing, the KCDC reminded the public to send warm regards and understanding especially to the people who are hard hit by the situation, including small business owners and students and parents who feel the stress of delayed school opening. The KCDC also encouraged people to practice “emotional closeness” while maintaining social distancing — keeping in touch with friends, family and neighbors and encouraging each other — and reminded people to seek professional help including psychiatric or counseling help if needed.
 
○ On 27 March, the KCDC and the KNIH will discuss forming and operating a council in private-public partnership for more active and efficient support for research on COVID-19, including diagnosis, vaccine, and treatment.
