** Reported from 9:00, 1 March to 0:00, 2 March
※ The interim classification is based on the reporting location, which may change depending on further epidemiological investigation.



 
○ As shifting the strategy from containment to mitigation, KCDC has released the 7th edition of COVID-19 protocol and guideline as effective the beginning on 2 March.
 
○ For confirmed cases, the case management team at local government composed of medical staff has classified a severity level of 4, and cases with higher severity will be hospitalized promptly at negative pressure room or infectious disease designated hospital. Cases who have low necessity for inpatient treatment but need to be isolated for the purpose of minimizing the transmission and monitoring will be provided with medical support at ‘Life treatment center’ which set up at each region. 
 
○ Medical staff will be assigned at ‘Life treatment center’ to monitor the health status of the cases in the center on a regular basis. If medical staff determines that inpatient treatment is needed, cases will be hospitalized promptly. If symptoms improve even while in hospital, the cases is discharged first. And they are transfer to Life treatment center or take care at home as determined by the doctor and the patient management group. The local government select facilities to designate the ‘Life treatment center’ which get a medial support from nearby hospital at each city and province. This system operates from Daegu city in the first place. 
 
○ KCDC emphasized the importance of personal hygiene practice and social distancing. It is critical that the public follows the guidance for COVID-19 prevention, such as washing hands with soap and running water and covering mouth and nose with elbow when coughing. 
 
○ Furthermore, anyone having fever or respiratory symptoms should avoid having in contact with others, visiting a crowded place, or attending religious gatherings. High-risk group, such as the elderly over 65 year old, people with underlying chronic conditions, and pregnant women, is advised not to visit a crowded place. 
 
○ When developing fever or respiratory symptoms, it is recommended not to go to school or work and avoid any outdoor activities. Such people should stay home and monitor the symptoms for 3-4 days. When high fever (>38°C) continues or the symptoms get worse, they should ① consult with KCDC Call Center at 1339 (or local code+120) or ② visit a triage health center. They should also wear a mask and use a personal vehicle when visiting a triage health center.
