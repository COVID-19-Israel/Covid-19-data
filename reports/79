* Not classified into a cluster or under investigation
** Confirmed from 9:00, 23 February to 9:00 24 February
※ The interim classification is based on the reporting location, which may change depending on further epidemiological investigation.



 
○ The Korean government has raised the alert level from Orange(Level 3) to Red (Level 4) in order to prepare for a possible nation-wide transmission. It was a proactive decision taking into consideration the pattern and speed of transmission.
 
 - Community transmission has been expanded from special management regions, Daegu (Shincheonji) and Cheongdo (Daenam Hospital). The newly confirmed cases are also mostly related to Shincheonji clusters. 
 
 - The government takes both containment and mitigation strategies, considering the different situations in regions. In the special management regions (Daegu and Cheongdo), the response measures are more focused on isolating and treating potential cases than tracing an individual case. Furthermore, medical resources are put into severe cases so as to mitigate the impact, such as death. In other regions, epidemiological investigation and environmental disinfection are conducted to find Shincheonji-related cases as well as to prevent sporadic community spread.
