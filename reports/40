○ 80.1% of the total cases have epidemiological links and 19.9% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each region or city are shown in the Table 1 next page. Distribution of the cases by sex and age groups are as indicated in Table 2.

○ There have been 90 cases confirmed at the call center located in Guro-gu, Seoul since 8 March. The epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are underway. 77 cases were known to work on the 11th floor. 553 other employees of the same company are currently under self-quarantine even though they work on different floors. Diagnostic test will be conducted as well if necessary.

○ Since the contact with the confirmed cases in a closed place increases the possibility of transmission, it is recommended to work at home or adjust desk locations so as to keep a certain distance among people  in the office. More detailed guidelines for local governments and high-risk working environment will be distributed soon.

○ Considering the increasing trend of global transmission, Central Disease Control Headquarters additionally designated Italy and Iran as the quarantine inspection required areas. Therefore, anyone with suspected symptoms should submit a health questionnaire at the point of entry, pass the special entry procedure, and install self-diagnosis application on their cell phone. They could be quarantined at the quarantine station and get tested for COVID-19 when necessary.
