○ KCDC pointed out that from this weekend to the early March would be a great turning point of COVID-19 outbreak in Korea and emphasized the importance of personal hygiene practice and social distancing. It is critical that the public follows the guidance for COVID-19 prevention, such as washing hands with soap and running water and covering mouth and nose with elbow when coughing. 
 
 - Furthermore, anyone having fever or respiratory symptoms should avoid having in contact with others, visiting a crowded place, or attending religious gatherings. High-risk group, such as the elderly over 65 year old, people with underlying chronic conditions, and pregnant women, is advised not to visit a crowded place. When they have to visit a health facility, they should wear a facemask.
 
 - When developing fever or respiratory symptoms, it is recommended not to go to school or work and avoid any outdoor activities. Such people should stay home and monitor the symptoms for 3-4 days. When high fever (>38°C) continues or the symptoms get worse, they should ① consult with KCDC Call Cetner at 1339 (or local code+120) or ② visit a triage health center. They should also wear a facemask and use a personal vehicle when visitng a triage health center.
