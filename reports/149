 □ The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has become the first government agency in Korea to collaborate with Marvel for a public service project promoting hand-washing and cough etiquette as part of a healthy lifestyle.

 ○ KCDC released a video titled “Dreaming of being a superhero!” featuring Marvel’s The Avengers on social media outlets, including YouTube and Facebook, as part of this public service campaign.

 ○ In order to reach young audiences and help them develop healthy habits from a young age, KCDC has prepared children’s posters promoting frequent hand-washing and cough etiquette and will be distributing them to preschools, kindergartens, and other childcare facilities. 

 □ KCDC Director Eun-kyeong Jeong emphasized the importance of healthy lifestyle habits, especially proper hand-washing and cough etiquette, in preventing the spread of infectious diseases and in leading healthy lives.
 ○ She also expressed that using popular characters like The Avengers is an effective way to reach the public and hopes that there will be many future projects using creative ways to promote public health and lead society free from the burdens of infectious diseases.
