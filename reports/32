○ 9 more cases were confirmed at the call center located in Guro-gu, which brings the total number of confirmed cases there to 124. Also, 13 confirmed cases have been reported from Saeng Myeong Su Church located in Bucheon, Gyeonggi province. One of the confirmed cases from the 11th floor of the call center attended the service at the church. Further epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are underway.
 
○ In the city of Sejong, a total of 29 confirmed cases turned out to be linked with the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. Tests were conducted for the entire staffs of the Ministry and 27 were confirmed positive. Two other cases are family members of the confirmed staff. Epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are on-going.
 
○ As new cases are continuing to emerge in small clusters from businesses, churches, Internet cafes, and medical facilities, KCDC stressed the need for stronger prevention measures especially with public spaces and facilities used by many people.
 
○ KCDC urged everyone to keep strict adherence to personal hygiene and social distancing measures during the upcoming weekend. Individuals with fever or respiratory symptoms are advised to refrain from going to work or school and generally stay at home and watch their symptoms for the next 3-4 days.
