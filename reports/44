*There was one deceased case in Busan, but the local government in charge of the case changed from Busan to Gyeongbuk.




○ 79.7% of the total cases have epidemiological links and 20.3% are either under investigation or individual cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each region or city are shown in the Table 1 next page.

○ In Daegu and Gyeongbuk region, the transmission seems a bit slow down as testing Shincheonji members is almost finished. However, since the confirmed cases continue to be reported from health facilities and community centers, the local governments are taking response measures to prevent further transmission at such facilities. In Seoul and Gyeonggi region as well, small-scale, sporadic outbreaks have been identified mainly at the places where high-risk groups visit often, such as health facilities and community centers. It is critical to strengthen the surveillance at these facilities.

○ Seven pregnant women have recently been confirmed of COVID-19. There is not much information about COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, but considering the main mode of transmission, droplet and contact, vertical transmission through blood or giving birth is unlikely. 

○ At this moment, it is required to take both measures, control of local transmission and prevention of additional importation, taking into account the current global situation. 

  - There have been 101 thousand confirmed cases with 3,700 deceased in 96 countries except Republic of Korea. According to WHO, 53 countries have local community transmission. Although transmission in China seems decreasing, there is a surge in other countries, such as Italy and Iran. Furthermore, more than 200 cases have been confirmed in the Unites States and Japan respectively. The situation and transmission trends in these countries are closely monitored. Central Disease Control Headquarters will share the monitoring results with the public in a timely manner and consider strengthening the quarantine inspection on travellers from the countries with local transmission.
