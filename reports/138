○ The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(KCDC) has announced that the case definition will be expanded in order to prevent further importation of 2019 novel coronavirus infection. As of 28 January 2020, the contaminated areas will be defined as entire mainland China. Therefore, any travellers departed from China will be a subject to strengthened screening and quarantine measures. They should fill out and submit health questionnaire to quarantine officer at the point of entry. Providing false information on travel history or symptoms could result in a fine of up to 10 million Korean won (equivalent to USD 10,000). Please refer to Figure 1 for the changes on the case definition in detail.
