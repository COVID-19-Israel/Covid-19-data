○ Epidemiological links have been found for 79.8% of the total cases; 20.2% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in the Table 2 on the following page. Distribution of the cases by sex and age groups are as indicated in Table 1.
 
○ A current total of 109 confirmed cases have been reported from the call center located in Guro-gu, Seoul since 8 March. Epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are underway. There is 1 newly confirmed case from an office located on the 10th floor of the same building as the call center on the 11th floor. Diagnostic tests have been conducted for the residents of the studio apartments located on 13-18th floors. All of the 186 tests conducted so far have turned out negative.
 
○ 26 cases have been confirmed in the city of Sejong, including 24 at the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. Epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are underway. Further tests are being conducted for staffs of the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. Self-quarantine measures have been taken by the contacts of the confirmed cases. 
 
○ The number of Shincheonji Daegu Church-related confirmed cases is showing a decline as KCDC’s investigation on the group comes to a close. However, as new cases are continuing to emerge in small clusters from businesses, churches, Internet cafes, and medical facilities, KCDC stressed the need for stronger prevention measures especially with public spaces and facilities used by many people.
 
○ KCDC urged everyone to keep strict adherence to personal hygiene and social distancing measures during the upcoming weekend, including fully covering sneezes and coughs with arm sleeves to prevent transmission via respiratory droplets and refraining from visiting closed community spaces or public gatherings.
 
○ KCDC also encouraged businesses and workplaces to adopt remote working environments for employees such as work-at-home and online collaboration. 

○ Extra care should be taken to keep clean any frequently used surfaces in living spaces. It is important to maintain proper ventilation of living spaces and maintain adequate exercise and healthy diet when staying at home. Individuals with fever or respiratory symptoms are advised to refrain from going to work or school and generally stay at home and watch their symptoms for the next 3-4 days.
