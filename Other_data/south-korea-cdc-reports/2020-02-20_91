○ Out of 36 newly confirmed cases, 35 were identified in Daegu and Gyeongbuk province, and one was in Seoul. 28 cases from Daegu and Gyeongbuk province are linked with Shincheonji Church of Jesus, The Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, the one that 31st case is associated with; two are with Cheongdo Daenam hospital, and five are currently being investigated. One case from Seoul is a patient with pneumonia, and he was confirmed positive today at the triage health center in Jongno-gu.
 
○ A total of 49 cases* were confirmed in Daegu and Gyeongbuk province. Investigation on their links with Shincheonji Church and Cheongdo Daenam hospital is currently underway. Since the 31st case was known to visit Cheongdo early February, KCDC is trying to find the source of transmission linked with both clusters (Shincheonji and Cheongdo Daenam hospital). At the same time, the patient and staff at Cheongdo Daenam hospital are being tested for COVID-19 and environmental disinfection is currently on-going.
 * One case(#31) reported on 18 February, 13 cases on 19 February, and 35 on 20 February
 
○ KCDC also advised that anyone who have attended a service at Shincheonji Church or visited Cheongdo Daenam hospital in February should stay home and avoid unnecessary outdoor activities. If they have fever or respiratory symptoms, they should first get a consultation with KCDC Call Center(1339) or a triage health center nearby before going to health care facilities.
 
○ The newly confirmed case in Seoul(#56) is a Korean male, born in 1945. He visited Jongno Community Center at the end of January, so epidemiological link with the 29th case has been investigated.
 
○ The 40th confirmed case has eight contacts, and all of them are closely monitored. The case developed cough on 11 February, and before isolation, he visited health care facilities and supermarket. The additional investigation is currently underway.
 
○ The 450 contacts of the 16th confirmed case were released from isolation as of today. 101 under either self-quarantine or isolation at health facility were all tested negative.
 
 
 
○ According to KCDC recommendation, anyone suspected to be exposed to the infected clusters should get tested immediately. Other cases should follow the physician’s guidance when it comes to getting tested for COVID-19.
