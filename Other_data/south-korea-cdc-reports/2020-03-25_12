○ Epidemiological links have been found for 82.4% of the total cases; 15.1% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 2.
 
○ From the call center building in Guro-gu, Seoul, no additional cases were confirmed. The current total is 158 confirmed cases since 8 March. Of the 158 confirmed cases, 97 are persons who worked in the building (11th floor = 94; 10th floor = 2; 9th floor = 1), and 61 are their contacts. The KCDC shared the interim result of their epidemiological investigation in collaboration with Seoul City, Incheon City, and Gyeonggi Province during the monitoring period of 9-22 March. The call center on the 11th floor had the highest infection rate (43.5%), compared to 7.5% and 0.5% for 10th and 9th floors, respectively. There was no confirmed case from other floors. Of the 226 persons identified as family members of the 97 confirmed cases who worked in the building, 34 (15.0%) were infected. Of the 97 confirmed cases, 8 (8.2%) were asymptomatic cases. Of the 16 persons identified as family members of the 8 asymptomatic confirmed cases, no confirmed case was found.
 
○ In Daegu, testing has been completed for every person at high-risk facilities. Of the 32,990 test results, 224 (0.7%) were positive results.
 
○ From Hansarang Convalescent Hospital in Daegu, 9 additional cases were confirmed. The current total is 101 confirmed cases since 16 March. (Patients in inpatient care = 75; staff = 2; discharged patients = 3; visitor = 1)
 
○ In light of the rise in the percentage of imported cases, screening at port entry and strict self-quarantine monitoring is important.

○ In light of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in the United States and the rise in the number of imported cases from the US, starting 0:00 of 27 March, a stronger screening process will be applied for inbound travelers from the United States. All symptomatic persons entering from the US, regardless of nationality, will be required to wait for testing in a facility within the airport. Persons who test positive will be transferred to a hospital or “Life Treatment Center”. Persons who test negative will enter self-quarantine at home for 14 days. Korean nationals and foreigners with a domestic residence who are asymptomatic at the time of entry will enter self-quarantine in their home for 14 days and get tested if symptoms begin to occur. Foreigners who are on a short-term visit without domestic residence and thus are unable to self-quarantine will be tested in at a temporary facility. If they test negative, they will be allowed entry under enhanced active monitoring. 
 
○ The Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters will strengthen the management of inbound travelers under self-quarantine. Persons subject to self-quarantine will be issued a self-quarantine notice at the airport. Failure to comply is punishable by imprisonment up to 1 year or a fine up to 10 million won. They are also required to install the self-quarantine mobile app (made by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety) on their phone, so that their local government can monitor their self-quarantine.
 
○ The KCDC urged all inbound travelers to follow the precautionary measures, including not leaving home for 14 days, minimizing contact with other people, not going to work, washing hands, covering sneezes and coughs. 
 
○ Any person who suspect onset of COVID-19 symptoms are advised to call the KCDC call center (1339) or local call centers (area code + 120), ask a local public health center, or visit a screening facility, before visiting a regular healthcare provider directly. All persons who visit a screening center should arrive wearing a mask and in their own car if possible, and disclose their international travel history to the healthcare professionals. 
 
○ The KCDC also advised employers to ensure that employees returning from international business trips will not return to their office for the first 2 weeks upon their return.
  
○ The KCDC stressed the importance of keeping a clean environment and asked citizens to follow the instructions for safe and proper use when using disinfectants. Frequently used surfaces and objects should be disinfected using a cloth wetted with 70% ethanol (alcohol) or diluted sodium hypochlorite (household bleach). Personal protective equipment (e.g. gloves, facemasks, waterproof apron) should be worn. The space should also be ventilated sufficiently.
 
○ In light of the continued emergence of outbreaks in various venues such as religious facilities and workplaces, the KCDC urged everyone to participate in enhanced social distancing campaign for the next 15 days (22 March – 5 April). Citizens are advised to stay home as much as possible other than for going to work, visiting a healthcare provider, and purchasing necessities. Working citizens are asked to maintain a distance from other people during lunch breaks, refrain from using break rooms and other social venues, and pay closer attention to maintaining personal hygiene (e.g. washing hands). Employers are advised to implement various methods of minimizing person-to-person contact for employees, such as reorganizing workspaces to ensure greater distancing and implementing work-from-home and flexible hours systems. Those who show symptoms should be advised not to show up at work. Workers who develop symptoms mid-day should be sent home immediately. The government has also limited the operation of high-risk facilities including religious facilities, some indoor fitness facilities, and nightlife venues. Venues that remain in operation must strictly comply with infection prevention guidelines (e.g. disinfecting, ventilation, distancing, mask wearing) set by the authorities.
