○ In addition, three confirmed cases(#3, #8, and #17) were tested negative twice in a row and will be discharged later today. Seven of the confirmed cases have been discharged so far.
 
○ COVID-19 extracted from patient specimen will be sent to relevant ministries and research institutes for virus culture and incubation. This will accelerate development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.
 
○ KCDC advised the public to get tested only if they have symptoms and epidemiological link. Testing for COVID-19 should be determined by clinician’s opinion. Furthermore, asking for a certificate to prove a negative test result for school or work should be discouraged.
